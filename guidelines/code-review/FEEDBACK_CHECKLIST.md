# Guidelines for conducting Code Review

## Sharing Feedback Checklist

1. Be sensitive when providing feedback, a line of code is a developer’s creation.
2. Ask for questions and clarification in case you have doubts.
3. Get to know more about their confidence in the code and how they perceive their work.
4. If you find something good/innovative, share that within the weekly Thursday meeting.
5. Sometimes you have opinions and suggestions which you’re not sure fit in the context of the code changes being reviewed. The thumb rule here is to voice your opinions and suggestions and let others share their thoughts on them. Better safe than sorry.
6. Ensure your previous comments and questions are addressed the next time you review the PR.
