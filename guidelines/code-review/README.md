## Understanding Requirements

Go through the requirements/bug reports before looking at the code. Be familiar with the developers' task.

## Self Review First! (For code owner)

Perform a sanity check first for items in the self-review checklist. The developer submitting the PR for review shouldâ€™ve taken care of pointers mentioned in the self-review checklist. If not, request the developer to self-review first.
