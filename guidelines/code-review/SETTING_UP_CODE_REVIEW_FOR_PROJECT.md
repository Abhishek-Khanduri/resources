## Setting up Code Review for a Project

**Set up a schedule** for conducting reviews.

1. Estimate how much developers will code every day. Based on the amount of code that would be shipped daily, set up a daily frequency of when the reviewers will receive requests to review code.
2. Set a ballpark limit for the maximum lines of change a reviewer is supposed to review in a PR, the ideal limit is 100-200 lines of change.
3. The conventional time consumed for a reviewer to review is 30 minutes to review 100 - 200 lines of change.
4. Developers should communicate with their reviewer a day (minimum) in advance, in case the amount of code to be shipped would increase. In that case, the reviewer can comfortably take care of other commitments and priorities.

**Assign reviewers** at the beginning project. There should ideally be 1 reviewer for 1 developer. Also a backup reviewer for each project, who would review code in the event that a reviewer is unavailable.

**Follow standard processes** of conducting reviews on GitHub.
