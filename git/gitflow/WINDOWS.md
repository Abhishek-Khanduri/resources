# Installation

### Requirements

1. Git

### Installing Git

1. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
1. Run the installer.
1. Once installation is completed. Initialize Git in your project directory with command
    ```shell
    git init
    ```

### Installing Gitflow

1. For Windows, Git with 2.5.3 and above ships with git-flow (the AVH edition of it), so we don't explicitly need to install git-flow. Once git is initialized in the project directory, we can get started with git-flow.
1. Initialize Gitflow in your project directory with command
    ```shell
    git flow init -d
    ```
    -d is used to choose default setting for git flow.
