# Git

> Advanced git users are advanced not because of the command they know but because of the way they use the tool. They are curating the same commits, putting together sensible units of work with a commit message that makes sense and will mean something to us when we go dig into it after three months.
— Lorna Jane Mitchell

This document covers some of the important concepts for Git version control and GitHub that a developer must learn. These may cover some very basic concepts to advanced concepts as well.
